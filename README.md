# Vigieau for home-assistant

Component to expose Vigieau status for the foreseable future. See https://vigieau.gouv.fr/ for web access.

This integration share location via a 3rd party (government) website (as the website does).

Data is based on the [propluvia](https://www.data.gouv.fr/fr/datasets/donnee-secheresse-propluvia/#/resources) dataset. It's really great to have access to such data.

## Installation

It must be used as a custom repository via hacs.

## Configuration

Once the custom integration has been added, add "vigieau" integration through the UI.
